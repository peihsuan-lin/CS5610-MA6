# Mini Assignment 6 - 2x2 grid toggle
Author: lin.peih@northeastern.edu

## Features
- Cell Toggle: Each cell in the grid toggles between black and white when clicked.
- On Cell Counter: A counter at the top dynamically reflects the current number of "on" cells.
- Extra Credit (Context Usage): Implemented Context to manage the counter state instead of passing props between parent and child components.
